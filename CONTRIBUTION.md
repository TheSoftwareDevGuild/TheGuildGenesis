Contributing to The Guild Genesis

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Please follow these steps before working on an issue or feature:

1. Join our Discord: https://discord.gg/pg4UgaTr
2. Create your profile on https://theguild.dev
3. Edit your Guild profile to include your Discord username (so we can verify your identity and attribute rewards).
4. Discuss the terms for fulfilling the ticket with Antoine (scope, deliverables, timeline).

Rewards and recognition

- Rule of thumb: 10 points per hour, 80 points per full day.
- Contribution tokens have no monetary value. They represent reputation and will grant voting rights in the Guild in the future. See the full on-chain specification in [CONTRIBUTION_TOKEN.md](CONTRIBUTION_TOKEN.md).
- Your contributions will also be recognized with badges on https://theguild.dev.

Process

- Pick an open issue and comment that you’d like to work on it, or propose a new one.
- Align requirements with Antoine in Discord before starting.
- Submit a PR referencing the issue. Include clear commit messages and a brief changelog in the PR description.
- Be responsive to review feedback; we’ll merge once acceptance criteria are met.
